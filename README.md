# DSA-Project 

Searching for patterns in a given text file using trie and suffix tree data structures and implementing KMP and finite automata algorithms

For tries a smaller text file will be opened since the space complexity of trie is O(m^2)
For other choices, the larger text file opens.

The user has to input the string of the pattern to be searched.
The output will be the number of occurrences of the pattern in the text file, the line number, and the position in the line of the text file.
